# Project Description
TravelQuery is a light and easy-to-read web tool. It was designed for people who travel often and want an easy way to discover weather and news reports for the town and/or city they are currently staying in. The site also features a search bar connected to the google search engine, to make fast, secure internet searches. 

This is a project site developed by Christopher Tsang, Darien Valet, James Denk, and Vince Rook. It was built for a group project through Kansas University's coding bootcamp program.

The API's used in this site are:
